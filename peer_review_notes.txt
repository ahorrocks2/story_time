notes:

Your Gemfile is laid out in a unique manner.

We had trouble getting the Gemfile to load properly. We deleted capybara-console from the Gemfile.lock and it worked.
We don't know why this happened and you're likely not to blame.

The homepage doesn't route to the main stories page, This could be fixed with: root :to => 'stories#index'

Rspec failed, 7 of 12 fail. We were able to get them to pass, here's the breakdown:

1. There were typos within the new story form and spec that confused Capy
2. The callbacks within the models Story and Sentence were changed from before_validation to before_save


Thanks all! Thanks for letting us look at your project, we love you.
